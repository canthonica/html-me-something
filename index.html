                        <p>It isn't out of the ordinary for military families to move periodically. In 16 years of service, our family had moved 5 times. I loved my career as a military musician but I was starting to think about closing my military career and rejoin civilian life at the 20 year mark. But, the
                        opportunity came for us to go the Europe and we decided to make another move.  Our move overseas was quite life changing. We uprooted my oldest son from his friends and the school that he was comfortable in and landed at Sembach Air Base, Germany (Now Sembach Kaserne U.S. Army Base). We moved into
                        the Village of Mehlingen. Everything was new and a bit overwhelming at first. We had to get familiar with a new language, food, a way to drive, in general, a  new life style.
                        As time went on, we would grow to love living in Germany. We took many trips and took a lot of wonderful pictures.

                    <p>Our overseas advertures continued while station at 2nd tour overseas. This time at Ramstein Air Base. We moved into a very quaint little village called Glan Muenchweiler. By now, the family was well entrenched in our way of life. This was home to our young boys. The youngest didn't really know any other place as home.
                    When it was time to leave, no one wanted to return because Germany had become our home.

                    <p>After a fantastic 6 years in Europe, we moved back to the U.S. We now live in Shiloh IL. I retired from Scott AFB in 2018, and 
                     now I am taking a computer programing class to add a completely new set of skills (Talk about out of my comfort zone). I am really happy that we decided to leave our comfort zone and live abroad. We had experiences that we'll likely never repeat. This is my first stay in the Mid-west and I am glad to call this area home. My children had to get
                    uprooted again and leave friends behind. Such is the life of a military family. They are resilient and have a new group of kids to call friends.</p>
